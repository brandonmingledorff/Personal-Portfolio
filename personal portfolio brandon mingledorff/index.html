				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>Hi! I am Brandon Mingledorff, a 17 year old from Jackson, TN and second year Dev.Catalyst participant. Last year, I was lucky enough to be able to participate in the trip to San Francisco along with the rest of the winners, and it was a wonderful experience. Hopefully, my hard work (and a little bit of luck) will carry into this year's competition as well!</p>
        <p>I love computers and technology, and I hope to extend my knowledge in the field enough to make a career out of it. I believe that now is the perfect time to follow the STEM path, and I plan to take full advantage of that.</p>

				<h3>My Projects</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4><strong><a href="https://github.com/brandonmingledorff/Web-Design-Contest-Entry-Spring-2016" target="_blank">Jackson's Teen Book Club Website</a></strong></h4>
						<span class="dates">Spring 2016</span>
						<p>This was my entry to the 2016 Dev.Catalyst Web Design competition. I worked alongside Brice Wyatt, and together we formed "Team Bread." This was a blast to make considering it was my first real journey into Web Design, and it gave me much more confidence in my organization and project management skills. This endeavor is what made me passionate about the work I want to make a career out of, and for that, I must thank the wonderful people at The CO. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><strong><a href="https://github.com/brandonmingledorff/Advanced-Web-Design-Contest-Entry-Spring-2017" target="_blank">Jackson's Charity Basketball League Website</a></strong></h4>
						<span class="dates">Spring 2017</span>
						<p>This site is my submission to this year's Dev.Catalyst competition under the Advanced Web Design category. It was created for JCBL, a charity basketball league here in Jackson. The site has a clean, visually pleasing interface and lots of great features to enhance the user experience. My partner this time around was Gabriel Storm, and we are both very excited to hear the results!</p>

				<h3>My Other Work</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4><strong><a href="This I Believe.pdf" target="_blank">Writing Sample - "This I Believe"</a></strong></h4>
						<p>This is an essay I wrote called "This I Believe" for my English III Honors class. The assignment was to write about what we believe is one of the most important characteristics a person can have. I chose hopefulness, and this essay explains my reasoning.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><strong><a href="Crows.pdf" target="_blank">Short Story Sample - "Crows"</a></strong></h4>
						<p>This is a short story I wrote for a Southwest Electric competition in which we had to write a less than 900 word story that included an explanation of "electric cooperatives." I tried to be funny; hopefully, it worked. </p>
